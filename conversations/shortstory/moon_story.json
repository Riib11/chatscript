Corporations own massive time machines and control the information about the past. Governments regulate time travel to prevent abuses, but they are frequently bribed by corporations, leading to a societal divide between those who can afford to visit the past and those who cannot.\n\nCharacters: The protagonist is Sarah, a middle-aged woman who has spent most of her life trapped in a dead-end job, longing to change her past. Her former college friend, Michael, works for one of the corporations that control time travel. Sarah views Michael as a symbol of all that she could have been.\n\nPlot: Sarah's obsession with time travel leads her to take out a loan to travel back to her college years, hoping to rewrite her past and become the person she always wanted to be. However, as she begins to manipulate her past self's life, Sarah realizes that her actions have unforeseeable consequences, including her own erasure from the timeline. Michael uses his role at the corporation to prevent Sarah's disappearance, although Sarah quickly gains a reputation among the corporation for her excessive time travel trips.\n\nSarah's addiction to traveling through time begins to take a negative impact on her life, as she becomes increasingly self-centered and unresponsive to the people around her. As Sarah's trips increase, so too does the frequency of their repercussions, as she finds herself running into versions of herself from alternate timelines. \n\nAs time becomes a finite resource, Sarah finds herself unable to secure any more trips, leading her to spiral into depression and regrets over her past decisions. Michael, who has finally recognized Sarah's journey as a way out of his job, offers her one final trip through time, warning her that it will likely be her last, as time travel options dwindle away. \n\nConclusion: Sarah, after walking through her previous choices, finally comes to the realization that her past is immutable, and all of her present issues have been because of her repeated attempts to reverse her life.

Her former friend Michael serves as a supervisor at one of these corporations and views Sarah's journey as a way to escape his dead-end job. \n\nPlot: After a few time travel trips, Sarah finds herself addicted to the thrill of the past and increasingly isolated from the present. Her continuous journeys through time have consequences that become increasingly difficult to predict, including meeting multiple versions of herself. Meeting her alternate selves causes her to lose a sense of her own identity, making her feel like her life has been stripped of any significance. \n\nMichael witnesses Sarah's journey and realizes its power to lead people beyond their present situations.

Imagine time as a fabric, and every visit as a tug on a string, and time moves on like clothing without repairing or fixing the remaining threads, creating an eventual tear. The governments pass laws limiting the use of time travel to preserve the time-space fabric, which results in making it nearly impossible for anyone to get the time-travel permits they need to enter the past.\n\nSarah finds herself desperate to time travel again, realizing that she only has one last chance to secure any more trips.

She had longed for the chance to relive her life, make new decisions, and change her path. The money she had received from a loan shark would either allow her to achieve her dream or ruin her life.\n\nAs she stepped into the machine, Sarah traveled back to her college years where she had once been free and full of hope. Initially, everything seemed to go well. But soon, changes she made in the past created consequences she could not have foreseen. Sarah returned from her time traveling trips as varied versions of who she was. And as she met different versions of herself from different timelines, she felt empty, without her sense of self.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael, a cynical supervisor at Congenix, realized that with the increasing societal divide, people needed a way out. He started a secret group that aimed to help people like Sarah escape their troubled pasts. The plan was to curate selected time travelers and provide them with the necessary support to find happiness and prosperity.\n\nThe group had a limited budget, and their numbers grew as they went to great lengths to keep everything under wraps. But whenever they saw Sarah, they saw a potential for a success story, and they started to train her up. They taught her how to achieve her goals without interfering too much with her past self. With this training, she could advance her life without conflicting with herself from the past.\n\nIt wasn't long before the world's leaders realized the Time-Domino Effect. They began passing laws to preserve the fabric of time-space, limiting travel to only emergencies. When Sarah realized that she could never go back in time again, she felt like she was losing herself. She had no way of knowing how different her life might have been had she made different choices.\n\nSarah could never overcome the feeling of having hit rock bottom. She started visiting doctors, but none of their medications restored her lost hope. It was the pity for Michael which spoke to her when he said, \"You have had so many opportunities to relive your life, and maybe I should not have allowed this path to grip you as tightly as it did. But understand that the opportunities to visit the past have run out, and our choices now lie in the present and future.\"\n\nWhen Sarah returned to her time, she realized the inevitability of it all.

Sarah could feel the crystalline framework of time-space being held together, about to shatter under her fingernails. It was as though Time had become a fragile construct of loose threads that would unravel at any moment, trapping her within Time itself. Sarah was left feeling lost - her opportunities to visit the past had run out, and yet her present self remained the same, mocking her like a terrible mirror.\n\nSarah saw Michael walking towards her, his voice rough and squeezed, \"I've always wondered whether to be a pawn at Congenix imprisoned me, but now I know it did.

She looked out the window, her glassy eyes looking out to the dim horizon. The world outside, the first things in her life that looked sure and steady, was nothing but awry shapes and patterns, vibrating and trembling, like an abstract painting captured in motion. It was as though she had been dropped into a reality that looked like a faceless sculpture.\n\nSarah looked out upon the world as a prisoner, held captive by the chains of her own making. She remembered the buzz of electricity when she first stepped into the machine, how grateful she had been to travel through time.

Sarah understood that she could only exist within the present moment, and though it was bittersweet, it was where her life lay entwined like a well-watered vine."}, "overwrite": false}]}
