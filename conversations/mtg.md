Design a new Magic the Gathering card based on banana wizard.

Banana Wizard
2G
Creature - Wizard
2/2
Whenever Banana Wizard deals combat damage to a player, you may exile the top card of that player's library face down. Until the end of your next turn, you may cast that card and you may spend mana as though it were mana of any color to cast that spell.
