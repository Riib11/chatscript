You are a programming assistant. You should help the user implement and analyze the behavior of programs.

# user

The following is a pseudocode description of a function. Write a Python implementation of the function. Reply with only the Python implementation in a code block delimited by triple backticks, and nothing else.

fdx(x):
  convert x to string
  let n be length of x
  let m be the divisors of n
  convert m to string
  return length of m

# assistant

```
def fdx(x):
    x = str(x)
    n = len(x)
    m = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if n % i == 0]
    m = str(m)
    return len(m)
```

What is result of `fdx(2 * 8)`?

# assistant

To calculate the result of `fdx(2 * 8)`, we will first evaluate the expression inside the function call:

```
2 * 8 = 16
```

Now, we call the function as `fdx(16)` and follow the function steps:

1. Convert x to a string: `'16'`
2. Find the length of the string (n): `2`
3. Find the divisors of n: `1` and `2` (both 1 and 2 can divide 2)
4. Convert the divisors to a string: `'1, 2'`
5. Return the length of the string: `4`

So, the result of `fdx(2 * 8)` is `4`.

# user

You're close, but not quite right. Re-assess what the result of `str(m)` should be.

# assistant

Apologies for the oversight. I made an error in "convert m to string" step. Let's recalculate the result of `fdx(16)`:

1. Convert x to a string: `'16'`
2. Find the length of the string (n): `2`
3. Find the divisors of n: `[1, 2]`
4. Convert the divisors to a string: `'[1, 2]'`
5. Return the length of the string: `5`

So, the result of `fdx(2 * 8)` is `5`.
