{"theme": "banana wizard", "card name": "Banana Wizard", "mana cost": "1G", "card types": "Creature - Wizard", "power/toughness": "2/2", "oracle text": "2/2\n\nWhenever you cast a spell with a green or yellow color identity, you may put a +1/+1 counter on Banana Wizard.\n\nT, Remove three +1/+1 counters from Banana Wizard: Create a 3/3 green Banana Golem creature token with trample named Banana Split. \n\n(Notes: This card encourages players to play green- and yellow-colored spells in their deck. The activated ability creates a powerful token creature, but requires some setup and isn't unlimited to prevent the card from being too overpowered.)"}
