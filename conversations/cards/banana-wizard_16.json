{"theme": "banana wizard", "card name": "Banana Wizard", "mana cost": "1G", "card types": "Creature - Wizard", "power/toughness": "2/2", "oracle text": "2/2\nWhen Banana Wizard enters the battlefield, you may search your library for a basic Forest card and put it onto the battlefield tapped. If you do, shuffle your library.\nWhenever you tap a Forest for mana, add an additional G to your mana pool.\n\n(Explanation: This card symbolizes the idea of a wizard who has harnessed the power of nature to cast spells. Bananas are often associated with jungles and forests, hence the forest-related abilities. The card is strong but has balanced mechanics that take some setup to be activated.)"}
