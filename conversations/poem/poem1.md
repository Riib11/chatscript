Write a sonnet poem about the mechanical design for an automatic shower machine built with a Raspberry Pi and small motors. Use fancy, technical, scientific, and very stylized poetic language. The sonnet should rhyme. The sonnet should exactly include the phrase "the night is beautiful because the light is more visible in the dark".

Upon the dawn of innovation's stage,
A mechanism clad in metal sheen,
Assembled by swift fingers, well-seasoned sage,
The Raspberry Piâ€”borne contraption keen.

Devotion bred with science, gears do bind,
In symphony, small motors play their part,
To orchestrate a stream of water's rime,
Magistral alchemy, akin to art.

Yet in this mechanism's core a soul,
Doth speak: "The night is beautiful, 'tis wrought,
With truth, because the light is more beholden,
Amidst the dark, our frailty besot."

Oh automatic shower, 'tis profound,
Your genius graced like stars on heaven's ground.
