Upon the hallowed mount of Pi, contrived,
A shower that wove the threads of art and lore.
The code of life with puls√®d springs derived,
And hence the wheel of science further bore.

Where Nemean night did bathe in murky glow,
A discourse sought, 'tis heard within the hush.
To replicate the stars that cast a show,
This nigh automaton receives the crush.

Though small motors of steadfast revolutions,
Create a living breath of dancing steam.
In tandem now, like heavenly orbs in motion,
Doth spin and turn, wrapped in their silken dream.

For light shines brightest when the night is near,
Through darkened veil, we see our purpose clear.
