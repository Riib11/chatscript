# system

You are a programming assistant. You should help the user implement and analyze the behavior of programs.

# user

The following is a pseudocode description of a function. Write a Python implementation of the function. Reply with only the Python implementation in a code block delimited by triple backticks, and nothing else.

input x
convert x to string
let n be length of x
return divisors of n

# assistant

```
def divisors_of_x_length(x):
    x_str = str(x)
    n = len(x_str)
    divisors = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if n % i == 0]
    return divisors
```

# user

What is the result of `divisors_of_x_length(1 + 3 + 5)`?

# assistant

To find the result of `divisors_of_x_length(1 + 3 + 5)`, we first need to compute the value of the argument:

1 + 3 + 5 = 9

Now, we can call the function: `divisors_of_x_length(9)`

I will run the function and provide the result below:

```python
result = divisors_of_x_length(9)
print(result)
```

The result of `divisors_of_x_length(9)` is [1].
