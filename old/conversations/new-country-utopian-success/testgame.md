You live in New York City. The year is 2014. You are a software developer at Amazon.

As the player, I decide to take some time off work and fly down to New Orleans to meet with a group of investors who are interested in supporting the creation of our new country.

Once I arrive in New Orleans, I check into my hotel and immediately begin to reach out to my contacts to schedule meetings with potential investors. I spend the next few days networking, sharing our plans and answering their questions.

Eventually, I secure the investment we need and we begin to put our plan into action. I return to New York and start assembling a team to help me create the infrastructure we need to build the artificial island and attract settlers to our new country.

Congratulations on securing the investment needed to bring your plan to life! A few weeks have passed since your return to New York, and your team is assembled and ready to begin work on the project.

The first hurdle you have to tackle is finding the right location to build your artificial island. After much research and consultations with experts, your team has found a suitable location in the Pacific Ocean. The site offers access to ample natural resources and a strategic location for trade.

Your next step is to finalize the design and start construction of the island. The project will take several years to complete, but with the funding secured, you're confident that you'll be able to make it happen.

What would you like to do next?

As the player, I gather my team to finalize the design of the island. We work together to come up with a detailed plan for the construction process, including timelines and milestones that we'll need to hit along the way.

I also reach out to architects, engineers, and other experts who can help us design and build the infrastructure we'll need to support a thriving community on the island. We'll need to establish a reliable power source, design a self-sustaining water and food supply, and create a transportation network that connects the island to the mainland.

Once we have our plan in place, we start construction on the island. I visit the construction site regularly to oversee the progress and make sure that everything is going according to plan.

As the island begins to take shape, I start reaching out to potential settlers and business partners who might be interested in joining us on this exciting new venture. I believe that we can create something truly special on this island, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for our new country.

With your team and experts, you work tirelessly to create a detailed plan for the construction and development process of the island. As construction begins, you visit the site regularly to ensure everything is going according to plan.

Over time, the island begins to take shape. The infrastructure necessary for a thriving community is developed, and the transportation network connecting the island to the mainland is complete.

As people become aware of your project, they express interest in joining your new country. Your team reviews each application carefully, selecting individuals and businesses that will be a good fit for the community.

With settlers and businesses arriving on the island, your new country is booming. The community thrives, and the vision you had for your project has become a reality.

Congratulations! You've successfully created a new country. What would you like to do next?

As the player, I feel a sense of pride and satisfaction in what we've accomplished. But I know that our work is not yet complete. There are still challenges ahead, and we'll need to remain vigilant to ensure that our country continues to prosper.

One of the biggest challenges we'll face is establishing our country's place in the global community. We'll need to build relationships with other countries and establish trade agreements to ensure that our economy remains strong.

Another challenge is ensuring that our community remains unified and that everyone has a voice in shaping our country's future. I'll work to establish a democratic government that reflects the values and needs of our community and provides opportunities for everyone to participate in the decision-making process.

Finally, we'll need to continue investing in the infrastructure and resources necessary to sustain our country's growth. That means developing new technologies, building new schools and hospitals, and providing opportunities for our people to prosper and thrive.

As I contemplate these challenges, I feel a sense of excitement and anticipation for what the future holds. We've created something truly remarkable, and I believe that our new country has the potential to become a beacon of hope and prosperity for the world.
