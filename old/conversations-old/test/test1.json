Which existing programming languages should I take inspiration from?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you're looking to restrict side-effects, languages that use functional programming paradigms may be a good place to start. Haskell is a good example of a functional programming language that enforces purity, meaning that function evaluation produces no side-effects, and that a function's return value depends only on its input arguments. Clojure also has a focus on immutability and immutable data structures.  For metaprogramming, languages like Lisp are known for their powerful macro facilities which allow users to extend the language itself, while languages like Ruby and Python offer more limited but still powerful capabilities for metaprogramming.  You may also want to look into newer languages like Rust and Swift which have a focus on safe systems- programming and preventing side-effects like null pointer exceptions and memory management errors. Overall, these languages can offer inspiration and provide ideas for how to approach building a language that prioritizes certain design features over others."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a detailed prototype specification of a new programming language that enforces purity and has a strong static and advanced type system, like Haskell, and also powerful macro facilities like Lisp."}, {"role": "system", "content": "\nHere is a prototype specification for a new programming language that enforces purity, has a strong static type system and advanced type system, and also includes powerful macro facilities:\n\n**Language Name:** PureLisp\n\n**Overview:**\n\nPureLisp is a relatively simple, interpreted programming language designed to encourage purely functional programming that is free of side effects. It is dynamically typed but also has an advanced static type system that provides strong type checking at compile time.  PureLisp also includes powerful macro facilities which allow users to extend the language itself, similar to Lisp.\n\n**Purity and Immutability:**\n\nIn PureLisp, all functions are pure functions, meaning they do not have any side effects, and the same input will always result in the same output. The language enforces immutability, meaning that once a value is created and assigned, it cannot be changed. \n\n**Variables and Types:**\n\nVariables in PureLisp are only allowed to be assigned a value once. Once a value is assigned, it is immutable. PureLisp has a strong type system that ensures that all data types are checked at compile time. Types in PureLisp include the basic data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans, as well as more complex data types like tuples, lists, sets, and dictionaries.\n\n**Functions:**\n\nFunctions are declared using the `def` keyword. Functions can take multiple arguments and return a single value. All functions in PureLisp are pure and cannot have any side effects. Functions can be composed together using the `compose` function.\n\n```lisp\n(def add (x y) (+ x y))\n(def subtract (x y) (- x y))\n\n;; Function composition\n(def subtract_from_add (x y) (compose subtract add))\n```\n\n**Macros:**\n\nPureLisp also includes powerful macro facilities that allow users to extend the language at compile time. Macros are defined using the `defmacro` keyword, and are evaluated before the code is evaluated. Macros can manipulate code and add new functionality to the language.\n\n```lisp\n(defmacro when (predicate body)\n  `(if ,predicate\n       (begin ,@body)))\n```\n\n**Control Structures:**\n\nPureLisp has basic control structures like conditionals and loops. Conditionals are expressed using the `if` keyword, while loops are expressed using recursion.\n\n```lisp\n;; If conditional\n(if (condition) \n    (true-branch)\n    (false-branch))\n\n;; Loop: sum all numbers in a list\n(def sum (list)\n  (if (null? list)\n      0\n      (+ (head list) (sum (tail list)))))\n```\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nPureLisp is an interpreted language, meaning that the code is evaluated at run-time. During evaluation, the interpreter uses the type system to check that all types are correct. Developers can also access a REPL (read-eval-print loop) to test code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, PureLisp is a powerful new programming language that enforces purity, encourages purely functional programming, and includes powerful macro facilities to add new functionality at compile time. PureLisp has a strong static and advanced types system to enforce correctness and avoid runtime errors. Although the language may be viewed as simple, its focus on purity and simplicity can encourage elegant code and efficient programs.\n"}]
