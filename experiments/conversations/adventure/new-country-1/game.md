You live in New York City. The year is 2014. You are a software developer at Amazon. The player starts researching potential investors for the creation of an artificial island, attends industry events to network and builds a team of like-minded individuals. They encounter challenges such as the temptation of taking shortcuts, negative feedback, and opposition from an organization opposed to the project. Despite these challenges, the player remains determined and sets out to create a more detailed plan to secure investment in the project. The player researches potential investors and builds a list of high net worth individuals to finance the creation of an artificial island nation. They work to improve their presentation after skeptics express doubts, attend industry events, and build a team. Despite opposition and challenges during the construction phase, the player overcomes obstacles through strategic problem-solving and ensures that the project ultimately moves forward.  However, an unexpected obstacle arises when a politician demands ownership in exchange for his support as the project nears completion.

As the player, I am determined to see this project to its end goal of creating a new independent country, so I refuse the politician's offer. Instead, I seek legal counsel to ensure that our team's rights and ownership are protected, and we proceed with the project as planned. While construction is nearly complete, I continue to network and gather support from media and political figures who view our endeavor as a step forward in self-governance and a new economic opportunity. 

As we near completion, I receive word that an environmental group is planning on protesting our project once it opens to the public. To address the concerns of the opposition, I spend time researching eco-friendly technologies and commission an environmental impact study to assess the potential harm our project might have on the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem. 

While the report shows that there may be some minor ecological impacts, I am able to present the findings to the environmental group and show them that we have made every effort to keep our project sustainable and eco-friendly. The protesters agree to a peaceful demonstration instead of trying to shut down the project altogether. Finally, construction ends and our nation is officially established!

As your nation is established, you suddenly receive a threatening letter from an unknown sender. The letter reads: "I know what you've done. Stop this project before it's too late. This will only end in disaster." 

This news unsettles you and makes you worry that someone is out to get you and your nation. You hire a private investigator to determine who the sender is and why they are making these threats. The investigation reveals that the sender is actually a competitor who was rejected in his plan to build a similar artificial island nation years ago. He has been jealous of your success and is now trying to sabotage your project.

You know that you cannot let this competitor bring you down. As a leader of your nation, you decide to take a proactive approach to keep your citizens and visitors safe. You develop a comprehensive security plan to avoid any unwanted incident from happening. The security personnel will patrol the area closely and background checks are a mandatory for all citizen applications. 

With the threat debunked and measures put in place, your nation is thriving. In a few years, it becomes one of the most thriving nations in the world. It also becomes a symbol of hope for those who desire a fresh start and more control of their lives. As the gamemaster, what would you like to do next?
