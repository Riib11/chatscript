Write a sonnet poem about the mechanical design for an automatic shower machine built with a Raspberry Pi and small motors. Use fancy, technical, scientific, and poetic yet easy-to-understand language. The sonnet should rhyme. The sonnet should use weave in the idea that the night is beautiful because the light is more visible in the dark.

Behold the whirring gears, the gleam of steel,
In motor's hum a wondrous tale to tell;
With gilded Raspberry Pi, the wheel
Of liquid blessings sent, in droplets swell.

Wrought from the mind, conceived in intellect,
A dance of cogent calculation springs,
To structure now the elements, select
And fit, design's blueprint boldly brings.

In the darkest hours upon twilight's throne,
The shimmer of beauty truly shines bright,
From unseen folds, the dance of light is shown,
Revealed the stars against the cloak of night.

Like luminescence in the midnight veil,
Made visible, this creation doth prevail.
