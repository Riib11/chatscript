First, we need to find the average $n$ of $1, 2, 3$ and the average $m$ of $4, 5, 6$. \n\nStep 1: Add the numbers for each average.\n$n = (1 + 2 + 3)$\n$m = (4 + 5 + 6)$\n\nStep 2: Divide each sum by 3 (since there are 3 numbers in each set).\n$n = (1 + 2 + 3) / 3$\n$m = (4 + 5 + 6) / 3$\n\nStep 3: Calculate the averages.\n$n = (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2$\n$m = (4 + 5 + 6) / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5$\n\nStep 4: Add the two averages.\n$m + n = 2 + 5$\n\nStep 5: Calculate the final answer.\n$m + n = 2 + 5 = 7$\n\nThe answer is 7, and the sequence of basic arithmetic operations is:\n1.
