Question: Let $n$ be the average of $1, 2, 3$. Let $m$ be the average of $4, 5, 6$. What is $m + n$?

Break the answer to this question into a sequence of basic arithmetic operations that use only addition and multiplication.

To find the average of a set of numbers, you add them up and then divide by how many numbers there are. First, we need to find the average $n$ of $1, 2, 3$ and the average $m$ of $4, 5, 6$. 

Step 1: Add the numbers for each average.
$n = (1 + 2 + 3)$
$m = (4 + 5 + 6)$

Step 2: Divide each sum by 3 (since there are 3 numbers in each set).
$n = (1 + 2 + 3) / 3$
$m = (4 + 5 + 6) / 3$

Step 3: Calculate the averages.
$n = (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2$
$m = (4 + 5 + 6) / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5$

Step 4: Add the two averages.
$m + n = 2 + 5$

Step 5: Calculate the final answer.
$m + n = 2 + 5 = 7$

The answer is 7, and the sequence of basic arithmetic operations is:
1. Add: (1 + 2 + 3)
2. Add: (4 + 5 + 6)
3. Divide: (1 + 2 + 3) / 3
4. Divide: (4 + 5 + 6) / 3
5. Add: 2 + 5
